He undergoes a very complex journey of self-discovery, identity, and healing throughout the Iron Man and Avengers series (particularly in Iron Man 3). From the outset of his character arc in the first movie, Tony is portrayed as a brilliant, yet "genius, playboy, philanthropist" individual who doesn't take many things seriously. However, it is through the traumatic experiences he endures that eventually reshape his identity and his understanding of heroism. 
<br> <br>
I believe Tony Stark's PTSD can be traced back to the events of the first Iron Man film. As a weapons manufacturer displaying many narcissistic traits, he is captured by a terrorist organization and forced to confront the grim reality that the weapons he manufactures are being used to kill innocent people. The sacrifice of his newfound friend, Ho Yinsen, during their escape adds to his burden of guilt. <iframe width="570" height="340"  style="padding:20px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SYG3IcScViA?si=kBzoz1XcCfTi7oSS" align= "right" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br> <br>
From this point on, we witness a shift in Tony, where his ego remains prominent, but he genuinely endeavors to rectify his mistakes and become a hero. However, much of this heroism he attributes not to himself, but to his invention, his Iron Man suit. In fact, his alter ego "Iron Man," becomes his crutch. When in his suit, he exudes overconfidence and a belief that he is invincible. Every "near-death" situation he encounters and every battle he fights in the suit, only reinforces this perception, leading him to feel untouchable when in the suit. In fact, during the first panic attack he has (when he thinks it could of been poisoned), he calls his suit before anyone else, before even responding to Rhody. Without his suit, Tony Stark feels stripped of his facade of invincibility. 
   
<br> <br>
This mindset leads to the events of the Avengers movie, where during the final battle in New York, Tony intercepts and redirects a nuclear missile to save the city. This near-death experience marks the inception of his PTSD. His PTSD is further explored in Iron Man 3 through recurring nightmares, anxiety attacks, and a growing reliance on his Iron Man suit as he grapples with the aftermath of New York and confronts his newfound vulnerabilities head-on.

      <section> <img align="left" width="50%" height="auto" style="padding:20px" img src="images/3415f0a136879d664490086ac53e0fce.gif"> Throughout Iron Man 3, Tony's trauma is triggered repeatedly, particularly by mentions of the New York incident. These triggers lead to debilitating panic attacks. While I typically dislike it when the media undermines serious moments with humor, this movie is an exception. Tony's defense mechanism is sarcasm and humor, so I feel like using humor in these scenes represents Tony trying to symbolically shield himself during moments of panic because it is still very clear that Tony is genuinely experiencing a lot of inner turmoil during these scenes and THAT is not cut with humor at all.
<br> <br>
    Leading from that point, Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of the physical symptoms of a severe panic attack, including labored breathing, constant fidgeting, and stuttering, is extremely accurate. One criticism of this portrayal is during a scene where Tony is driving and experiences a panic attack. He calls Harvey about his suit's charge while en route to a terrorist hideout. When Harvey informs him that the suit isn't charging, Tony spirals into a massive panic attack because, like I mentioned before, he's reliant on the suit. However, Harvey's reminder, "You're a mechanic, right? Build something!" during his panic attack immediately snaps him out of it. This might be “unrealistic” from a moment’s glance, however, I think, if you take into account the rest of his character arc, it makes perfect sense.

    <section> <img align="right" width="25%" height="auto" style="padding:20px" img src="images/anigif_sub-buzz-22976-1556740822-2.gif">This statement from Harvey is a pivotal moment for Tony. This is when Tony realizes that his suits do not define him. Despite his deep-seated fear of vulnerability and mortality throughout the films, this half-hearted attempt to make Tony stop panicking actually leads Tony to realize that his true strength lies not in his suit, but in himself. He is a mechanic! He got himself out of the hostage situation in the first movie. He came up with the idea to redirect the nuke into the wormhole. He could go to home depot and build ANYTHING he wanted–and that is exactly what he did. That wasn’t his suit, that was him. His intellect. The armor was merely a tool, the real hero was the man who wore it. <br> <br>
In the first Avengers movie, Captain America says, "Take off that suit and what are you?" <br> By the end of the third movie, it's clear: Tony Stark was Iron Man, and a suit of armor wouldn't change that.
