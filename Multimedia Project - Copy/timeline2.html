       <p> <h1> “Puss In Boots: The Last Wish” (2022) </h1> 
    When I headed to the theater to watch "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish," I wasn't expecting much. I mean, let's face it, it's a sequel to a forgettable spinoff about a side character from "Shrek." But boy, was I in for a surprise. Sure, I could gush about the animation and the plot, but what really blew me away was how well and authentically the movie tackled anxiety and panic attacks.
<br> <br>
Our feline hero, Puss, is living the high life, basking in his own glory and taking adrenaline-seeking risks without a second thought. He's never faced a real threat, he has never been cut by a blade, he has never felt the fear of being hunted, scared, or helpless, but when Death itself, embodied by the menacing antagonist, the Wolf, slashes him across the face, everything changes. Suddenly, Puss is confronted with his own mortality, and it terrifies him to the core. This event triggers a genuine panic in him, sending him on a quest to follow a map to a wishing star to regain his feline nine lives before Death catches up to him.

Every reminder of the Wolf sends him spiraling into panic. He freezes, his eyes go wide, and his fur stands up. His fear and anxiety take over him. He goes into fight or flight mode every time he sees the Wolf. The scene where Death (the wolf) merely whistles and watches him during the big fight, unseen by anyone else except Puss, is bone-chilling. The Wolf, or Death, looming in the background of every fight is a constant reminder of mortality, pushing Puss to the brink of a genuine panic and forcing him to confront his deepest fear, death.
            <br> <br> 
           What sets this movie apart is how it portrays anxiety with raw authenticity. In a world where panic attacks in film are often overdramatized, "Puss in Boots" takes a completely different approach. The movie is the literal definition of “show, dont tell" and the panic attack scenes are simple, yet powerful, focusing on the uncontrollable breathing and racing heartbeat.

           <br><br> Unlike many other instances in the media (like seen in “Velma” and multiple instances within the show “Friends”), the scenes does not undercut the seriousness of the panic attack with humor. There are no flashy effects or dramatic music cues, just the stark reality of a panic attack. By breaking conventional filmmaking techniques, the directors of this movie depicted Puss’s struggles with emotional authenticity, resonance, and offered validation for anyone who's ever struggled with anxiety/panic attacks.             
            <br> <br>

I also love that the film ends with Puss choosing to face his anxiety. By standing his ground, picking up his blade, and facing death head on, he becomes something even better than a fearless hero.
