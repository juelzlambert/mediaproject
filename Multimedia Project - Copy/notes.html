  <h1 style>Ending Notes</h1>
In exploring these visual narratives, it's clear that how mental illness and trauma are depicted in the media matters deeply. The characters I covered, like Jinx from "Arcane," Puss from "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish," and Iron Man from the Iron Man series and "The Avengers,‚Äù are not just fictional figures; they're complex people whose stories, despite being grounded in fiction/entertainment, reflect real struggles. Their stories spark vital conversations about mental health, and when creators handle these themes with care and authenticity, they validate the experiences of countless individuals facing similar challenges. They also chip away at the stigma surrounding mental illness, reminding us that, despite our struggles we are still human. 
<br> <br> <b>They illuminate the very essence of what it means to be human.<b>
