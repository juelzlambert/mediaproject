    <p> <h1> “Arcane” (2021)</h1>
In the Netflix series "Arcane" (which is based on the game League of Legends), mental health issues and trauma are deeply woven into the story through the character of Powder (also known as Jinx later in the story). Powder's journey through the show is marked by profound loss, trauma, and abandonment. 
    
 <br> <br> After losing both of her parents in a civil war, Powder grows up with her sister, Violet, her makeshift family of Mylo and Claggor, and Vander, a distant father figure in her life. Powder is forced to grow up quickly and constantly seeks validation/acceptance from her new family, however, Powder's clumsiness and habit for making mistakes earn her the nickname "Jinx" from Mylo who is constantly putting her down and yelling at her. 
The only person who ever stood up for her was her sister, Vi, who realizes that Powder is still a child who shouldn't be expected to perfect 100% of the time, but Powder still has a lot of insecurities about being capable. This is seemingly because she doesn't want to be left behind during missions. She fears abandonment…which makes sense because she's already lost her real family at such a young age. She can't bear the thought of losing anybody else because she was perceived as “not good enough” or as a “jinx,” which is exactly what ends up happening.

    Later in the story, she arrives where her adoptive father is being held hostage, without knowing that Vi, Mylo, and Claggor, had already rescued him successfully. Powder, with the intent to help them escape, threw a hand-made bomb into the building which leads to a devastating explosion that ends up claiming the lives of Vander, Mylo, and Claggor. After finding out it was her sister who blew up the building and killed her adoptive family, the only remaining person she has left, Vi, strikes and abandons her. So, who does she have left? <b> No one. </b> 
<br> <br>
This moment serves as a catalyst for Powder's descent into darkness and her vulnerability is preyed upon by the big bad guy of the story, Silco, who capitalizes on her trauma to mold her into the chaotic and "evil" persona of Jinx.

<br> In the second act of the story, we witness the transformation of Powder into Jinx. During this transition, we follow a troubled teenager grappling with intense schizophrenia, PTSD, and haunting hallucinations that torment her with the faces of those she unintentionally killed in her childhood. Jinx is also mentally and emotionally stunted, often exhibiting behaviors of a young child. Silco (the big bad guy), on top of that, saw her chaotic and violent potential and put a gun in her hands and told her to do as he wished. By the end of the first season, this leads to her fully embracing her new name and identity, "Jinx." Jinx emerges as a deeply troubled and psychologically complex character, grappling with trauma-induced psychosis, borderline personality disorder, and panic attacks caused by PTSD.
        <br> <br> Her mental illness and trauma definitely has a part in her fall from grace, but it is not her mental illness that made her violent.  And while it's true that Vi started Jinx’s descent into the “Jinx” persona by leaving her, Silco shaped and molded her into the mentally twisted killer that she becomes.

The show boldly confronts the repercussions of her actions, illustrating the harm she inflicts on those around her. While her descent into insanity is portrayed with empathy, the series does not excuse her behavior. 
    Instead, it explores the complex interplay between trauma and villainy. This netflix series shows that victims can sometimes become victimizers.
<br> <br>
     The hallucination sequences in the show are also genius and a testament to its attention to detail/psychological depth. They are shot with a jittery camera and coupled with garbled voices that very effectively immerse the viewer in Jinx's fractured psyche. The flashes of the past are interesting too! These traumatizing events are always distorted by graffiti–which is Jinx’s signature piece of identity. To me, this reflects Powder's desire to erase or conceal her history by embracing her new persona. <iframe width="560" height="315"  margin-left= "40 px" style="padding:20px" align="left" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ECNDL5tlWsQ?si=mxcwdNWSJ1GbgiZu&amp;clip=Ugkx5Vxb2fTPLQgx0Go98zhC_P9cSjyugpwC&amp;clipt=EK7SBRiOpwk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-whn-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>  On the other hand, this also portrays her descent into madness with vivid symbolism that could only be captured by visual media. The flashing colors are wonderful stylistic choice to help the viewer understand the chaos and confusion that she is experiencing in her head. 
<br> <br>  
In summary, I think "Arcane" delivers a very compelling portrayal of Jinx's mental health struggles due to her trauma. To me, this was very surprising. Unlike her portrayal in the game as a mere "Harley Quinn," cute/chaotic without meaning, and romantizied/idolized type of character, the show delves into the tragic complexities of her narrative with a lot of well-researched nuance, understanding, and empathy. She is not just an irredeemable monster, the audience is actually rooting for her redemption rather than wanting to see her be defeated by the protagonists. Jinx is simply a case of what could happen when the world is unkind to children experiencing significant trauma. <br> <br>
